```

### Install with Docker

You need [Docker Desktop][docker_desktop] before you can continue with the run.

To run the development mode you have this command:

### Structures Files

> [!WARNING]
> the structure of the project to be changed, this can change in the future.

The project bot have the following structure directory and files for valid modules

``` js
üì¶services
 ‚îó üìÇcolors // name of the service 
   ‚î£ üìÇbuttons 
   ‚î£ üìÇmenus
   ‚î£ üìÇmodals
   ‚î£ üìÇbuttons
   ‚îó üìÇcommands
     ‚îó üìÇmain/index.ts // in the file index.ts you can define the command, use main as reference to the main command
üì¶events
 ‚îó üìÇsomeEvent/index.ts // the events will follow with the same structure.
```

> [!INFO]
> the next name files/directories are reserved and cannot be executed.
> `/shared`, `.gitkeep`, `someFile.ts` and `someFile.js`.

However, these files require a defined export to be taken as valid.

### Command File

This is a example of a command file:

```typescript
/* index.ts*/

import { SlashCommandBuilder } from 'discord.js'
import { CommandsNames } from '../../enums'
import { BuildCommand } from '../../buildersSchema'

const name = CommandsNames.nameCommand

export default BuildCommand({
  cooldown: 60,
  name,
  scope: 'owner',
  data: new SlashCommandBuilder().setName(name).setDescription('some Description'),
  async execute(interaction) {
    return { content: 'Hello! Im command üéÅ' }
  }
}) satisfies BaseFileCommand
```
